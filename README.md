# Aho-Corasick-Algorithm

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm that efficiently finds all occurrences of a set of keywords in a given text. Unlike traditional string searching algorithms like the naive string matching algorithm or the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which have a time complexity of O(nm) and O(n + m) respectively (where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern), the Aho-Corasick algorithm offers a time complexity of O(n + z + occ), where n is the length of the text, z is the total number of occurrences of the keywords in the text, and occ is the number of occurrences reported.

**Key Features**
Efficient Multiple String Search: Aho-Corasick algorithm can search for multiple patterns simultaneously, making it ideal for tasks such as searching for keywords in a large body of text.
Optimized for Large Datasets: The algorithm is designed to efficiently handle large datasets, making it suitable for applications where quick search operations are necessary, such as in intrusion detection systems, network security, and bioinformatics.
Failure Function: A key component of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is the failure function, which allows for fast transition between states during the search process, reducing the overall time complexity.
Output Function: The algorithm employs an output function to determine the occurrences of patterns in the text efficiently.

**Algorithm**
Build Trie:
Initialize a Trie data structure.
For each pattern in the set of keywords:
Insert the pattern into the Trie.
Set the corresponding output value for the state representing the end of the pattern.
Build Failure Function:
Initialize a failure function array f[] with default values of -1.
Initialize a queue.
For each character in the alphabet:
If there is an edge from the root to a state labeled with the current character:
Set the failure function value of the state to 0.
Enqueue the state.
While the queue is not empty:
Dequeue a state state.
For each character in the alphabet:
If there is an edge from state to a state labeled with the current character:
Find the deepest proper suffix state failure of state labeled with the current character.
Set the failure function value of the state to failure.
Merge the output values of state and failure.
Enqueue the state.
Search Words:
Initialize the current state to 0.
For each character in the text:
Update the current state using the transition function and failure function.
If the current state has an output value:
Report the occurrence of keywords based on the output value.

**#Time Complexity**
The time complexity of the Aho-Corasick algorithm can be broken down as follows:

Preprocessing (Building the Trie): O(m), where m is the total length of all keywords.
Building Failure Function: O(m), where m is the total length of all keywords.
Searching (Finding Matches): O(n + z + occ), where n is the length of the text, z is the total number of occurrences of the keywords in the text, and occ is the number of occurrences reported.

**Usage**
The Aho-Corasick algorithm can be employed in various applications, including:

Text search and indexing
Intrusion detection systems
Network security
DNA sequence analysis
Natural language processing
Conclusion
The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a powerful tool for efficiently searching for multiple patterns in a given text. Its time complexity makes it suitable for handling large datasets, making it a valuable asset in various fields where fast and accurate pattern matching is required.
